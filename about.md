The ENLIGHT Consensus Project developed the ENLIGHT Checklist and Guidelines.

Abstract
========

Beyond vision, light has wide-reaching effects on human health and well-being. However, there is no consensus on reporting light characteristics in studies 
investigating non-visual responses to light. This project aimed at developing a reporting checklist for laboratory-based investigations on the impact of light on 
non-visual physiology. To this end, a four-step modified Delphi process (three questionnaire-based feedback rounds and one face-to-face group discussion) involving 
international experts was conducted. Across these four rounds, an initial list of 61 items related to reporting light-based interventions was condensed to a final 
checklist containing 25 items, based upon consensus among experts (final n=60). Nine of these items were determined to be necessary to report regardless of the 
specific research question or context. A description of each item was provided in the accompanying guidelines. Most participants (92%) reported being satisfied or 
very satisfied with the consensus process, checklist, and guidelines. The ENLIGHT Checklist and Guidelines are the first consensus-based guidelines for documenting 
and reporting ocular light-based interventions for human studies. The implementation of the checklist and guidelines will enhance the impact of light-based 
research by ensuring comprehensive documentation and reproducibility and enabling data aggregation across studies.
